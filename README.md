# Flickr data converter

This app creates folder structure with albums as folders that contains photos from the downloaded flickr data files.

### How to download your data from Flickr
1. Click the profile photo in the top right corner; select Settings.
2. Under “Your Flickr Data”, click the blue button that says Request My Flickr Data.
3. Once your .zip files are created, you will receive notifications to both your FlickrMail and your personal Flickr contact email containing a link to download your files. Links to your .zip files can also be found back in your account settings under “Your Flickr Data”.

After downloading all the zip files you need to unzip them. Then you can run this app by specifying the full path to folder with unzipped files with --data parameter and the full path to output folder with --output parameter.
